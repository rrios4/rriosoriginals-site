For the inspiration to create, build, deploy, and promote. Keep up the great work! 🙏


Been working this for past 3 months during my extra time to do a major overhaul to the initial release of the app. The initial release was part of my senior CIS Capstone class at University of Houston 🎓 with Jose Carlos Martinez, PhD - Houston  requiring us to approach a small business and improve their workflow by creating a software to digitize their important information. In this case the small business is my Dad’s roofing company, he works as a subcontractor and some times we get recommended to do jobs directly with the customer.

After using the v1.0 for 1 year I ran into limitations when managing invoices, quotes, and customer data and the lack of PDF exports was major 😔. Went to back to the drawing board to streamline the management of data and add meaningful features to it. Major design changes, major refactoring, new tech stack for scalability, and many more… My goal was to create a small ecosystem that integrates together to grow with the business 📈. Before I would create invoices/quotes in excel, save them on OneDrive, then email them to the customer and it would be a nightmare searching the file system to refer back to previous information. 

Now with the website we can take in new request for a roofing service quote, market our small business, manage new request with revamped app, get reporting for all the info in the system and much more… A one stop ✋ place to manage all the information we work with on a daily. 🥳 

If you know code 👨‍💻 I made the codebase free and open source for the internal company app check it out:
